This is an edit made on June 19, 2025 as a test.

**UPDATE FROM CURSOR**: Testing bi-directional sync after resolving conflict!

**NEW EDIT**: This edit should trigger the file watcher and sync to WordPress automatically!

**FINAL TEST**: The file watcher should detect this change! While automatic WordPress sync needs auth permissions, you can manually sync via the dashboard.
