# Bluehost Deployment Guide for Senior Tech Connect

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your Senior Tech Connect website to Bluehost hosting.

## Prerequisites
- Bluehost hosting account
- FTP client (FileZilla recommended) or access to Bluehost File Manager
- Your website files (built using `npm run build`)

## Step 1: Build Your Website for Production

1. Open your terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. This creates an `out` folder with all your static files

## Step 2: Prepare Files for Upload

After building, you'll find these important folders/files:
- `out/` - Contains all your website files
- `out/index.html` - Your homepage
- `out/_next/` - Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- `out/about/` - About page
- `out/login/` - Login page
- `out/register/` - Registration page

## Step 3: Upload to Bluehost

### Option A: Using Bluehost File Manager
1. Log into your Bluehost control panel
2. Go to "File Manager"
3. Navigate to `public_html` folder (this is your website's root)
4. Delete any existing files (like default index.html)
5. Upload all contents from the `out` folder to `public_html`

### Option B: Using FTP Client (FileZilla)
1. Download and install FileZilla
2. Get your FTP credentials from Bluehost:
   - Host: Your domain name or server IP
   - Username: Your cPanel username
   - Password: Your cPanel password
   - Port: 21
3. Connect to your server
4. Navigate to `public_html` folder
5. Upload all contents from the `out` folder

## Step 4: Configure Domain

1. In Bluehost control panel, go to "Domains"
2. Make sure your domain points to the `public_html` folder
3. If using a subdomain, create it and point it to the correct folder

## Step 5: Test Your Website

1. Visit your domain in a web browser
2. Test all pages:
   - Homepage (/)
   - About page (/about/)
   - Login page (/login/)
   - Register page (/register/)
3. Check that all images and styling load correctly

## Important Notes

### Static Website Limitations
Since this is now a static website, some features are limited:
- **Authentication**: Currently shows demo messages. For real authentication, integrate with:
  - Auth0
  - Firebase Authentication
  - Supabase Auth
- **Database**: No server-side database. Consider:
  - Firebase Firestore
  - Supabase
  - Airtable
- **Contact Forms**: Use services like:
  - Formspree
  - Netlify Forms
  - EmailJS

### File Structure on Server
```
public_html/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (Homepage)
â”œâ”€â”€ about/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ login/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ register/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ _next/ (CSS, JS, and other assets)
â””â”€â”€ images and other static files
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Errors**: Make sure all files are in the correct directories
2. **Missing Styles**: Ensure the `_next` folder is uploaded completely
3. **Images Not Loading**: Check that image files are in the correct paths
4. **Blank Pages**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Performance Optimization:
- Enable Gzip compression in Bluehost
- Use Bluehost's CDN if available
- Optimize images before uploading

## Future Enhancements

To add dynamic functionality later:
1. **Contact Form**: Integrate with Formspree or EmailJS
2. **User Authentication**: Add Auth0 or Firebase Auth
3. **Database**: Use Firebase or Supabase for user data
4. **Blog/CMS**: Consider headless CMS like Strapi or Contentful

1. Check Bluehost documentation
2. Contact Bluehost support
3. Verify all files are uploaded correctly
4. Check browser developer tools for errors
