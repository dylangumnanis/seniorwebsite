# 🎥 Session Testing Guide - Fixed Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Camera/Microphone Control Separation**
- **Problem**: One user could control other user's camera/mic
- **Fix**: Each user now controls only their own media devices
- **Test**: Toggle camera/mic on each account - should only affect that user

### 2. **Video Display Areas**
- **Problem**: Camera appeared in wrong location
- **Fix**: Local video shows in small corner, remote video in main area
- **Test**: Turn on cameras - you should see yourself in corner, other person in main area

### 3. **Camera Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Camera LED stayed on even when toggled off
- **Fix**: Proper track management with `.stop()` method
- **Test**: Toggle camera off - LED should turn off immediately

### 4. **UI Layout**
- **Problem**: Session info blocked "End Session" button
- **Fix**: Moved session info to top-left, End Session button clear in top-right
- **Test**: Both elements should be visible and clickable

### 5. **Screen Sharing**
- **Fix**: Proper screen capture with fallback to camera
- **Test**: Click screen share button - should share screen to other user

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Setup:**
1. Open two browser tabs/windows
2. Navigate to `/session/test-session-1` in both
3. Add `?role=senior` to one URL, `?role=volunteer` to the other

### **Test Camera Controls:**
1. **Senior tab**: Click camera button
   - ✅ Should see camera toggle for senior only
   - ✅ Should see senior's video in corner of senior tab
   - ✅ Should see senior's video in main area of volunteer tab

2. **Volunteer tab**: Click camera button
   - ✅ Should see camera toggle for volunteer only
   - ✅ Should see volunteer's video in corner of volunteer tab
   - ✅ Should see volunteer's video in main area of senior tab

### **Test Audio Controls:**
1. **Each tab**: Click microphone button
   - ✅ Should only affect that user's microphone
   - ✅ Red icon when muted, gray when enabled

### **Test Camera Cleanup:**
1. **Each tab**: Turn camera ON, then OFF
   - ✅ LED light should turn off immediately
   - ✅ Video preview should disappear
   - ✅ Other user should not see video

### **Test Screen Sharing:**
1. **One tab**: Click screen share button
   - ✅ Browser should prompt for screen/window selection
   - ✅ Other user should see shared screen
   - ✅ Click again to stop - should return to camera

### **Test UI Layout:**
1. **Both tabs**: Check top corners
   - ✅ Top-left: Session info (topic, duration, status)
   - ✅ Top-right: End Session button (red, clearly visible)
   - ✅ No overlap between elements

### **Test Session End:**
1. **Either tab**: Click "End Session"
   - ✅ All media devices should stop (LED off)
